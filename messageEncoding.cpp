/* This module is for the encoding and decoding of the message from a string to a big integer. This module takes an input of a string message and converts it into a big int of size 2^200 bits. It takes every 25 characters of the string or less, if there is less than 25 or number not divisible by 25, for the final integer. Since each character is 8 bits long and n is 200 bits this enables the program to put 25 characters into the formation of one big integer. It returns an array of these big integers in which every character has been accounted for in a big int in the vector. It also has another function in which it converts an array of big integers, z, into a string message. This is especially useful for the decoding phase of the El Gamal system.
