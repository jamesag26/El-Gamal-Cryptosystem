/* This module is for taking an input of integer n which is the desired number of bits for the length of the prime p. It also takes an input of integer t which is the level of desired confidence that the prime p is prime. This module outputs a prime number p and a primitive root g of p. There are 4 functions in this module. The first one handles the calling of the other functions associated with finding a random prime number p. It consists of a loop which gets a random number x by calling the getRandNum function and providing it with the size n and a seed to generate the random number. It tests this random number to see if its prime by calling the boolean function isPrimeTest. isPrimeTest takes input of int t for the number of trials to perform for the primality test and the random number to test primality on. It returns true if it passes every test and false if not. After getting a random number x that is prime the getPrime function also checks to see if p=2x+1 also yields a prime number and if not restarts the loop again until p is prime. This module has one more function getPrimitiveRoot which takes an input of prime p and outputs a primitive root g which is randomely generated until it passes the test of being a primitive root.
